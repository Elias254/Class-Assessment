Unit of measure - Percentage of adults aged 18+ years with a body mass index (BMI) of 30 kg/m2 or higher.  
Sample size - 2416 population-based measurement studies with 128.9 million participants.  
RATE_PER_100_N - the crude rate of obesity per 100 individuals in the population, calculated without any adjustments.
RATE_PER_100_NL - represents a normalized or adjusted rate per 100 individuals, taking into account demographic factors like age, sex, or geographic region. This metric is often age-standardized, meaning it adjusts for differences in age distribution across populations or countries, ensuring fair comparisons.  
RATE_PER_100_NU - could represent a rate per 100 individuals calculated using unadjusted data or a different normalization methodology compared to NL. It might be a region-specific rate or based on raw sample data rather than being age-standardized.
